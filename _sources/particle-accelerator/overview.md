# Particle Accelerator Simulation

During my undergrad at UCLA, I served as a Project lead for the Upsilon Laboratory, tasked with leading a team in building a particle accelerator simulation in Python.We Implemented object-oriented  methodology to resemble subatomic particles and utilized the Runge-Kutta 4th order integration algorithm to solve electromagnetic differential equations and gather data of interest. Dynamic attribute updates allowed the model to accurately resemble relativistic principles and effects. 

This project is divided into a quick introduction of the Physics and History Particle Accelerator followed by the code written in Python.
